It's a basic todo app using React which is a simple application that allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks or todos.
 Here's a summary of how it typically works:

User Interface: The app consists of a user interface where users can view a list of todos, add new todos, mark todos as completed, and delete todos.

Components: The app is structured into components using React. Common components include:

TodoList: Displays the list of todos.
TodoItem: Represents an individual todo item.
TodoForm: Allows users to add new todos.
App: Main component that renders the entire application.
State Management: React state is used to manage the todos data and their status (completed or not completed). The todos are stored as an array of objects, with each object representing a todo item containing properties like id, text, and completed.

Functionality:

Adding Todos: Users can input a new todo into a form and submit it. The new todo is added to the list of todos.
Completing Todos: Users can mark a todo as completed by clicking a checkbox or a button associated with each todo item. The completed todos are visually distinguished from the incomplete ones.
Deleting Todos: Users can delete a todo from the list by clicking a delete button associated with each todo item.
Persisting Data: Optionally, the app can store todo data in the browser's local storage to persist todos between sessions.
Styling: The app is styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Styles are applied to components to define their appearance, layout, and behavior.
